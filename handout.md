### Working Locally

General work cycle
      * Write code
      * . add
      * commit

##General
Set up a github account.  Can be free account with name/password.  Good place for offsite backup of work, apart from where our 'source of truth' will be.

Remember git (like UNIX) is case-sensitive.


#Best Practices
Work from a **working** or **feature** branch, not **master**

Use 'git status' frequently to be sure where you are, what needs to be committed or removed (like .origin files)

Use 'git config' if you need to change some of your configuration.
